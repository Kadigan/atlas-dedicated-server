# ATLAS MMO tools, configurations files, examples, tutorials

This repo is a collection of various tools, scripts, tutorials etc. related to the (very new as of 2018-12-29) ATLAS MMO Dedicated Server.

Most of the configuration you find here is sourced either from _ARK: Survival Evolved_  dedicated server knowledge, or from the `ServerGrid.json` files themselves.
